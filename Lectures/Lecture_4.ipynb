    "Recall that when we defined condition number, we relied on the notion of norm. In today's lecture, we will formalize this notion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A norm (usually denoted as $\\magn{\\cdot}$) is a mapping from the underlying vector space (say $V$) to set of non-negative real numbers ($[0,\\infty)$) satisfying the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\magn{\\cdot}: V \\mapsto [0,\\infty)$\n",
    "2. $\\magn{v} = 0$ iff $v = 0$\n",
    "3. For all $v \\in V$ and $\\alpha \\in \\Rb$, $\\magn{\\alpha v} = \\abs{\\alpha} \\magn{v}$\n",
    "4. **Triangle inequality**: For all $v,w \\in V$, we have $$\\magn{v+w} \\leq \\magn{v} + \\magn{w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On a given vector space, there can be many possible norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common norm on $\\Rb^n$ is the $p$-norm defined as below. Consider $x = \\begin{bmatrix}x_1 & x_2 & \\cdots & x_n\\end{bmatrix}^T \\in \\Rb^n$. We then define the $p$-norm of the vector $x$ as\n",
    "$$\\magn{x}_p = \\bkt{\\abs{x_1}^p + \\abs{x_2}^p + \\cdots + \\abs{x_n}^p}^{1/p}$$\n",
    "It is immediate to note that the $p$-norm as defined above is a norm only when $p \\geq 1$. (**Exercise**: Check)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $$\\lim_{p \\to \\infty} \\magn{x}_p = \\max_i \\abs{x_i}$$\n",
    "is also a valid norm on $\\Rb^n$ (**Exercise**: Check). This norm is denoted as $\\magn{x}_{\\infty}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix norms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A \\in \\Rb^{m \\times n}$. We could take inspiration from the way we have defined norms on $\\Rb^n$ to define matrix norms, i.e., we could define the $p$-norm (for $p \\geq 1$) of the matrix as $$\\bkt{\\dsum_{i=1}^m \\dsum_{j=1}^n \\abs{A_{ij}}^p}^{1/p}$$\n",
    "The above is indeed a valid norm. However, in the cases of matrices, we would prefer the norm to satisfy an additional criteria, namely the notion of sub-multiplicativity. We say that a matrix-norm ($\\magn{\\cdot}$) is sub-multiplicative if\n",
    "$$\\magn{AB} \\leq \\magn{A} \\magn{B}$$\n",
    "The way we have defined the $p$-norm above, it is easy to show that the norm is not sub-multiplicative always (except for $p=2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more natural definition of matrix-norm is the notion of vector induced matrix norm, which is defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\magn{A}_{p,q} = \\max \\left\\{\\dfrac{\\magn{Ax}_{p}}{\\magn{x}_q}: x \\in \\Rb^n - \\{0\\}\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to show that (**Exercise**: Check) the above definition can also be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\magn{A}_{p,q} = \\max \\left\\{\\magn{Ax}_{p} : \\magn{x}_q = 1 \\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $p=q$, it is convinient to denote that above as just $\\magn{A}_p$ instead of $\\magn{A}_{p,p}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma**: $\\magn{A}_{\\infty} = \\text{Maximum absolute row sum of the matrix} = \\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}} \\dsum_{j=1}^n \\abs{A_{ij}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**:\n",
    "We have\n",
    "$$\\magn{A}_{\\infty} = \\max \\left\\{\\magn{Ax}_{\\infty} : \\magn{x}_{\\infty} = 1 \\right\\}$$\n",
    "i.e.,\n",
    "$\\magn{A}_{\\infty} = \\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}} \\abs{\\dsum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}x_j}$ subject to the condition that $\\max_j \\abs{x_j} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have\n",
    "$$\\abs{\\dsum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}x_j} \\leq \\dsum_{j=1}^n \\abs{A_{ij}} \\abs{x_j} \\leq \\dsum_{j=1}^n \\abs{A_{ij}} $$\n",
    "where the last inequality is due to the fact that $\\abs{x_j} \\leq \\max_k \\abs{x_k} = 1$. Let $i^*$ be the row number corresponding to the largest row sum. Hence, we see that\n",
    "$$\\magn{A}_{\\infty} \\leq \\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}} \\dsum_{j=1}^n \\abs{A_{ij}} = \\dsum_{j=1}^n \\abs{A_{i^* j}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now note that equality can be attained by choosing the vector $x_j = \\text{sign}\\bkt{A_{i^* j}}$. Hence, we see that\n",
    "$$\\magn{A}_{\\infty} = \\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}} \\dsum_{j=1}^n \\abs{A_{ij}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $\\magn{A}_{\\infty}$ is the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix."
